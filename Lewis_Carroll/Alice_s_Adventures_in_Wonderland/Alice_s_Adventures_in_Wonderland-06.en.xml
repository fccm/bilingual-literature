<head3 id="en00281">Pig and Pepper</head3>

<para id="en00282">
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do
next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood&mdash;(she
considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by
his face only, she would have called him a fish)&mdash;and rapped loudly at the
door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a
round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had
powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know
what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</para>

<para id="en00283">
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly
as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn
tone, &ldquo;For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play
croquet.&rdquo; The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only
changing the order of the words a little, &ldquo;From the Queen. An invitation
for the Duchess to play croquet.&rdquo;
&lt;br/&gt;
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.</para>

<para id="en00284">
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear
of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone,
and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into
the sky.</para>

<para id="en00285">
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</para>

<para id="en00286">
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sort of use in knocking,&rdquo; said the Footman,
&ldquo;and that for two reasons. First, because I&rsquo;m on the same side of
the door as you are; secondly, because they&rsquo;re making such a noise
inside, no one could possibly hear you.&rdquo; And certainly there &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a
most extraordinary noise going on within&mdash;a constant howling and sneezing,
and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.</para>

<para id="en00287">
&ldquo;Please, then,&rdquo; said Alice, &ldquo;how am I to get in?&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00288">
&ldquo;There might be some sense in your knocking,&rdquo; the Footman went on
without attending to her, &ldquo;if we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt;, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know.&rdquo; He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. &ldquo;But perhaps he can&rsquo;t help
it,&rdquo; she said to herself; &ldquo;his eyes are so &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; nearly at
the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.&mdash;How am I
to get in?&rdquo; she repeated, aloud.</para>

<para id="en00289">
&ldquo;I shall sit here,&rdquo; the Footman remarked, &ldquo;till
tomorrow&mdash;&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00290">
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming
out, straight at the Footman&rsquo;s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke
to pieces against one of the trees behind him.</para>

<para id="en00291">
&ldquo;&mdash;or next day, maybe,&rdquo; the Footman continued in the same
tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.</para>

<para id="en00292">
&ldquo;How am I to get in?&rdquo; asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</para>

<para id="en00293">
&ldquo;&lt;i&gt;Are&lt;/i&gt; you to get in at all?&rdquo; said the Footman.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first question, you know.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00294">
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
really dreadful,&rdquo; she muttered to herself, &ldquo;the way all the
creatures argue. It&rsquo;s enough to drive one crazy!&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00295">
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark,
with variations. &ldquo;I shall sit here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on and off,
for days and days.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00296">
&ldquo;But what am &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; to do?&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00297">
&ldquo;Anything you like,&rdquo; said the Footman, and began whistling.</para>

<para id="en00298">
&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no use in talking to him,&rdquo; said Alice
desperately: &ldquo;he&rsquo;s perfectly idiotic!&rdquo; And she opened the
door and went in.</para>

<para id="en00299">
The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end
to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle,
nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron
which seemed to be full of soup.</para>

<para id="en00300">
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s certainly too much pepper in that soup!&rdquo; Alice said
to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</para>

<para id="en00301">
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately
without a moment&rsquo;s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not
sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and
grinning from ear to ear.</para>

<para id="en00302">
&ldquo;Please would you tell me,&rdquo; said Alice, a little timidly, for she
was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first,
&ldquo;why your cat grins like that?&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00303">
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Cheshire cat,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;and
that&rsquo;s why. Pig!&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00304">
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but
she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so
she took courage, and went on again:&mdash;</para>

<para id="en00305">
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I
didn&rsquo;t know that cats &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; grin.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00306">
&ldquo;They all can,&rdquo; said the Duchess; &ldquo;and most of &rsquo;em
do.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00307">
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any that do,&rdquo; Alice said very politely,
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</para>

<para id="en00308">
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know much,&rdquo; said the Duchess; &ldquo;and
that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00309">
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as
well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to
fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to
work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby&mdash;the
fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.
The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was
howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows
hurt it or not.</para>

<para id="en00310">
&ldquo;Oh, &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt; mind what you&rsquo;re doing!&rdquo; cried Alice,
jumping up and down in an agony of terror. &ldquo;Oh, there goes his
&lt;i&gt;precious&lt;/i&gt; nose!&rdquo; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it,
and very nearly carried it off.</para>

<para id="en00311">
&ldquo;If everybody minded their own business,&rdquo; the Duchess said in a
hoarse growl, &ldquo;the world would go round a deal faster than it
does.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00312">
&ldquo;Which would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be an advantage,&rdquo; said Alice, who felt very
glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.
&ldquo;Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see
the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis&mdash;&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00313">
&ldquo;Talking of axes,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;chop off her
head!&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00314">
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the
hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be
listening, so she went on again: &ldquo;Twenty-four hours, I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt;; or
is it twelve? I&mdash;&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00315">
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;,&rdquo; said the Duchess; &ldquo;I
never could abide figures!&rdquo; And with that she began nursing her child
again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent
shake at the end of every line:</para>

<para id="en00316">
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Speak roughly to your little boy,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And beat him when he sneezes:&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; He only does it to annoy,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he knows it teases.&rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; CHORUS.&lt;br/&gt;
(In which the cook and the baby joined):&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Wow! wow! wow!&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00317">
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby
violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could
hardly hear the words:&mdash;</para>

<para id="en00318">
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I speak severely to my boy,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I beat him when he sneezes;&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; For he can thoroughly enjoy&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pepper when he pleases!&rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; CHORUS.&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Wow! wow! wow!&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00319">
&ldquo;Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!&rdquo; the Duchess said to
Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. &ldquo;I must go and get ready to
play croquet with the Queen,&rdquo; and she hurried out of the room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.</para>

<para id="en00320">
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little
creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, &ldquo;just like a
star-fish,&rdquo; thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a
steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening
itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as
much as she could do to hold it.</para>

<para id="en00321">
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist
it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left
foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open
air. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t take this child away with me,&rdquo; thought
Alice, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn&rsquo;t it
be murder to leave it behind?&rdquo; She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grunt,&rdquo; said Alice; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not at all a
proper way of expressing yourself.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00322">
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see
what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt;
turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were
getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of
the thing at all. &ldquo;But perhaps it was only sobbing,&rdquo; she thought,
and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</para>

<para id="en00323">
No, there were no tears. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to turn into a pig, my
dear,&rdquo; said Alice, seriously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing more to do
with you. Mind now!&rdquo; The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it
was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.</para>

<para id="en00324">
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, &ldquo;Now, what am I to do with
this creature when I get it home?&rdquo; when it grunted again, so violently,
that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be
&lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.</para>

<para id="en00325">
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot
away quietly into the wood. &ldquo;If it had grown up,&rdquo; she said to
herself, &ldquo;it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather
a handsome pig, I think.&rdquo; And she began thinking over other children she
knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, &ldquo;if
one only knew the right way to change them&mdash;&rdquo; when she was a little
startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards
off.</para>

<para id="en00326">
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought:
still it had &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it
ought to be treated with respect.</para>

<para id="en00327">
&ldquo;Cheshire Puss,&rdquo; she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all
know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
&ldquo;Come, it&rsquo;s pleased so far,&rdquo; thought Alice, and she went on.
&ldquo;Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00328">
&ldquo;That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,&rdquo; said the
Cat.</para>

<para id="en00329">
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care where&mdash;&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00330">
&ldquo;Then it doesn&rsquo;t matter which way you go,&rdquo; said the Cat.</para>

<para id="en00331">
&ldquo;&mdash;so long as I get &lt;i&gt;somewhere&lt;/i&gt;,&rdquo; Alice added as an
explanation.</para>

<para id="en00332">
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re sure to do that,&rdquo; said the Cat, &ldquo;if you
only walk long enough.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00333">
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
&ldquo;What sort of people live about here?&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00334">
&ldquo;In &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; direction,&rdquo; the Cat said, waving its right paw
round, &ldquo;lives a Hatter: and in &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; direction,&rdquo; waving the
other paw, &ldquo;lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they&rsquo;re both
mad.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00335">
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to go among mad people,&rdquo; Alice remarked.</para>

<para id="en00336">
&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; said the Cat: &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
all mad here. I&rsquo;m mad. You&rsquo;re mad.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00337">
&ldquo;How do you know I&rsquo;m mad?&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00338">
&ldquo;You must be,&rdquo; said the Cat, &ldquo;or you wouldn&rsquo;t have come
here.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00339">
Alice didn&rsquo;t think that proved it at all; however, she went on &ldquo;And
how do you know that you&rsquo;re mad?&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00340">
&ldquo;To begin with,&rdquo; said the Cat, &ldquo;a dog&rsquo;s not mad. You
grant that?&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00341">
&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00342">
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; the Cat went on, &ldquo;you see, a dog growls when
it&rsquo;s angry, and wags its tail when it&rsquo;s pleased. Now &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; growl
when I&rsquo;m pleased, and wag my tail when I&rsquo;m angry. Therefore
I&rsquo;m mad.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00343">
&ldquo;&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; call it purring, not growling,&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00344">
&ldquo;Call it what you like,&rdquo; said the Cat. &ldquo;Do you play croquet
with the Queen to-day?&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00345">
&ldquo;I should like it very much,&rdquo; said Alice, &ldquo;but I
haven&rsquo;t been invited yet.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00346">
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see me there,&rdquo; said the Cat, and vanished.</para>

<para id="en00347">
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things
happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly
appeared again.</para>

<para id="en00348">
&ldquo;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&rdquo; said the Cat.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d nearly forgotten to ask.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00349">
&ldquo;It turned into a pig,&rdquo; Alice quietly said, just as if it had come
back in a natural way.</para>

<para id="en00350">
&ldquo;I thought it would,&rdquo; said the Cat, and vanished again.</para>

<para id="en00351">
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear,
and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March
Hare was said to live. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen hatters before,&rdquo; she said
to herself; &ldquo;the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won&rsquo;t be raving mad&mdash;at least not so mad
as it was in March.&rdquo; As she said this, she looked up, and there was the
Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.</para>

<para id="en00352">
&ldquo;Did you say pig, or fig?&rdquo; said the Cat.</para>

<para id="en00353">
&ldquo;I said pig,&rdquo; replied Alice; &ldquo;and I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t
keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00354">
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained
some time after the rest of it had gone.</para>

<para id="en00355">
&ldquo;Well! I&rsquo;ve often seen a cat without a grin,&rdquo; thought Alice;
&ldquo;but a grin without a cat! It&rsquo;s the most curious thing I ever saw
in my life!&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00356">
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the
March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were
shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house,
that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the
lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then
she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself &ldquo;Suppose it
should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I&rsquo;d gone to see the Hatter
instead!&rdquo;</para>
