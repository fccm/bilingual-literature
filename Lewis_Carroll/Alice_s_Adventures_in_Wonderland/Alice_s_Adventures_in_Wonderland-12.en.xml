<head3 id="en00881">Alice&rsquo;s Evidence</head3>

<para id="en00882">
&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment
how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a
hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting
all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay
sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had
accidentally upset the week before.</para>

<para id="en00883">
&ldquo;Oh, I &lt;i&gt;beg&lt;/i&gt; your pardon!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the
accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
they would die.</para>

<para id="en00884">
&ldquo;The trial cannot proceed,&rdquo; said the King in a very grave voice,
&ldquo;until all the jurymen are back in their proper
places&mdash;&lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;,&rdquo; he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard
at Alice as he said so.</para>

<para id="en00885">
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the
Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about
in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and
put it right; &ldquo;not that it signifies much,&rdquo; she said to herself;
&ldquo;I should think it would be &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; as much use in the trial one way
up as the other.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00886">
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and
their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to
work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the
Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth
open, gazing up into the roof of the court.</para>

<para id="en00887">
&ldquo;What do you know about this business?&rdquo; the King said to Alice.</para>

<para id="en00888">
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00889">
&ldquo;Nothing &lt;i&gt;whatever?&lt;/i&gt;&rdquo; persisted the King.</para>

<para id="en00890">
&ldquo;Nothing whatever,&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00891">
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very important,&rdquo; the King said, turning to the jury.
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
Rabbit interrupted: &ldquo;&lt;i&gt;Un&lt;/i&gt;important, your Majesty means, of
course,&rdquo; he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces
at him as he spoke.</para>

<para id="en00892">
&ldquo;&lt;i&gt;Un&lt;/i&gt;important, of course, I meant,&rdquo; the King hastily said,
and went on to himself in an undertone,
&lt;br/&gt;
&ldquo;important&mdash;unimportant&mdash;unimportant&mdash;important&mdash;&rdquo;
as if he were trying which word sounded best.</para>

<para id="en00893">
Some of the jury wrote it down &ldquo;important,&rdquo; and some
&ldquo;unimportant.&rdquo; Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look
over their slates; &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t matter a bit,&rdquo; she thought
to herself.</para>

<para id="en00894">
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his
note-book, cackled out &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; and read out from his book,
&ldquo;Rule Forty-two. &lt;i&gt;All persons more than a mile high to leave the
court&lt;/i&gt;.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00895">
Everybody looked at Alice.</para>

<para id="en00896">
&ldquo;&lt;i&gt;I&rsquo;m&lt;/i&gt; not a mile high,&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00897">
&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; said the King.</para>

<para id="en00898">
&ldquo;Nearly two miles high,&rdquo; added the Queen.</para>

<para id="en00899">
&ldquo;Well, I shan&rsquo;t go, at any rate,&rdquo; said Alice: &ldquo;besides,
that&rsquo;s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00900">
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the oldest rule in the book,&rdquo; said the King.</para>

<para id="en00901">
&ldquo;Then it ought to be Number One,&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00902">
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. &ldquo;Consider your
verdict,&rdquo; he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.</para>

<para id="en00903">
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,&rdquo;
said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; &ldquo;this paper has just
been picked up.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00904">
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo; said the Queen.</para>

<para id="en00905">
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t opened it yet,&rdquo; said the White Rabbit, &ldquo;but
it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to&mdash;to somebody.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00906">
&ldquo;It must have been that,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;unless it was
written to nobody, which isn&rsquo;t usual, you know.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00907">
&ldquo;Who is it directed to?&rdquo; said one of the jurymen.</para>

<para id="en00908">
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t directed at all,&rdquo; said the White Rabbit; &ldquo;in
fact, there&rsquo;s nothing written on the &lt;i&gt;outside&lt;/i&gt;.&rdquo; He unfolded
the paper as he spoke, and added &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a letter, after all:
it&rsquo;s a set of verses.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00909">
&ldquo;Are they in the prisoner&rsquo;s handwriting?&rdquo; asked another of
the jurymen.</para>

<para id="en00910">
&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said the White Rabbit, &ldquo;and
that&rsquo;s the queerest thing about it.&rdquo; (The jury all looked puzzled.)</para>

<para id="en00911">
&ldquo;He must have imitated somebody else&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; said the King.
(The jury all brightened up again.)</para>

<para id="en00912">
&ldquo;Please your Majesty,&rdquo; said the Knave, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t write
it, and they can&rsquo;t prove I did: there&rsquo;s no name signed at the
end.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00913">
&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t sign it,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;that only
makes the matter worse. You &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; have meant some mischief, or else
you&rsquo;d have signed your name like an honest man.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00914">
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever
thing the King had said that day.</para>

<para id="en00915">
&ldquo;That &lt;i&gt;proves&lt;/i&gt; his guilt,&rdquo; said the Queen.</para>

<para id="en00916">
&ldquo;It proves nothing of the sort!&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;Why, you
don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re about!&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00917">
&ldquo;Read them,&rdquo; said the King.</para>

<para id="en00918">
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. &ldquo;Where shall I begin, please your
Majesty?&rdquo; he asked.</para>

<para id="en00919">
&ldquo;Begin at the beginning,&rdquo; the King said gravely, &ldquo;and go on
till you come to the end: then stop.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00920">
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:&mdash;</para>

<para id="en00921">
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;They told me you had been to her,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And mentioned me to him:&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; She gave me a good character,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But said I could not swim.&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; He sent them word I had not gone&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (We know it to be true):&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; If she should push the matter on,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What would become of you?&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; I gave her one, they gave him two,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You gave us three or more;&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; They all returned from him to you,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though they were mine before.&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; If I or she should chance to be&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Involved in this affair,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; He trusts to you to set them free,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exactly as we were.&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; My notion was that you had been&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Before she had this fit)&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; An obstacle that came between&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Him, and ourselves, and it.&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him know she liked them best,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For this must ever be&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; A secret, kept from all the rest,&lt;br/&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between yourself and me.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00922">
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most important piece of evidence we&rsquo;ve heard
yet,&rdquo; said the King, rubbing his hands; &ldquo;so now let the
jury&mdash;&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00923">
&ldquo;If any one of them can explain it,&rdquo; said Alice, (she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasn&rsquo;t a bit afraid of
interrupting him,) &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him sixpence. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; don&rsquo;t
believe there&rsquo;s an atom of meaning in it.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00924">
The jury all wrote down on their slates, &ldquo;&lt;i&gt;She&lt;/i&gt; doesn&rsquo;t
believe there&rsquo;s an atom of meaning in it,&rdquo; but none of them
attempted to explain the paper.</para>

<para id="en00925">
&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no meaning in it,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;that
saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn&rsquo;t try to find any. And
yet I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he went on, spreading out the verses on his
knee, and looking at them with one eye; &ldquo;I seem to see some meaning in
them, after all. &ldquo;&mdash;&lt;i&gt;said I could not swim&lt;/i&gt;&mdash;&rdquo; you
can&rsquo;t swim, can you?&rdquo; he added, turning to the Knave.</para>

<para id="en00926">
The Knave shook his head sadly. &ldquo;Do I look like it?&rdquo; he said.
(Which he certainly did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;, being made entirely of cardboard.)</para>

<para id="en00927">
&ldquo;All right, so far,&rdquo; said the King, and he went on muttering over
the verses to himself: &ldquo;&lsquo;&lt;i&gt;We know it to be true&lt;/i&gt;&mdash;&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s the jury, of course&mdash;&lsquo;&lt;i&gt;I gave her one, they gave him
two&lt;/i&gt;&mdash;&rsquo; why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you
know&mdash;&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00928">
&ldquo;But, it goes on &lsquo;&lt;i&gt;they all returned from him to
you&lt;/i&gt;,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00929">
&ldquo;Why, there they are!&rdquo; said the King triumphantly, pointing to the
tarts on the table. &ldquo;Nothing can be clearer than &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;. Then
again&mdash;&lsquo;&lt;i&gt;before she had this fit&lt;/i&gt;&mdash;&rsquo; you never had
fits, my dear, I think?&rdquo; he said to the Queen.</para>

<para id="en00930">
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began
again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</para>

<para id="en00931">
&ldquo;Then the words don&rsquo;t &lt;i&gt;fit&lt;/i&gt; you,&rdquo; said the King,
looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</para>

<para id="en00932">
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pun!&rdquo; the King added in an offended tone, and
everybody laughed, &ldquo;Let the jury consider their verdict,&rdquo; the King
said, for about the twentieth time that day.</para>

<para id="en00933">
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;Sentence first&mdash;verdict
afterwards.&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00934">
&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; said Alice loudly. &ldquo;The idea of having
the sentence first!&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00935">
&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; said the Queen, turning purple.</para>

<para id="en00936">
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Alice.</para>

<para id="en00937">
&ldquo;Off with her head!&rdquo; the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
Nobody moved.</para>

<para id="en00938">
&ldquo;Who cares for you?&rdquo; said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by
this time.) &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing but a pack of cards!&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00939">
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she
gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them
off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her
sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down
from the trees upon her face.</para>

<para id="en00940">
&ldquo;Wake up, Alice dear!&rdquo; said her sister; &ldquo;Why, what a long
sleep you&rsquo;ve had!&rdquo;</para>

<para id="en00941">
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve had such a curious dream!&rdquo; said Alice, and she told
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of
hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her
sister kissed her, and said, &ldquo;It &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a curious dream, dear,
certainly: but now run in to your tea; it&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo; So Alice
got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful
dream it had been.</para>

<para id="en00942">
But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand,
watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful
Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her
dream:&mdash;</para>

<para id="en00943">
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were
clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into
hers&mdash;she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer
little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt;
always get into her eyes&mdash;and still as she listened, or seemed to listen,
the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her
little sister&rsquo;s dream.</para>

<para id="en00944">
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by&mdash;the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool&mdash;she could
hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their
never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her
unfortunate guests to execution&mdash;once more the pig-baby was sneezing on
the Duchess&rsquo;s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it&mdash;once
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard&rsquo;s
slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air,
mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.</para>

<para id="en00945">
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,
though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull
reality&mdash;the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool
rippling to the waving of the reeds&mdash;the rattling teacups would change to
tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen&rsquo;s shrill cries to the voice of the
shepherd boy&mdash;and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of
the busy farm-yard&mdash;while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would
take the place of the Mock Turtle&rsquo;s heavy sobs.</para>

<para id="en00946">
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in
the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all
her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she
would gather about her other little children, and make &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt;
eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows,
and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life,
and the happy summer days.</para>

<para id="en00947">THE END</para>
